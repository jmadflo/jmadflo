### Greetings! My name is Juan Madero, and I'm a full-stack web developer who is committed to building great internet products and services that will improve people's lives.  
- I'm currently working as a Full Stack Development Intern at A.I. Insurance, a startup which is a member of Y-Combinator Class of 2018. I'm building an advanced search feature for them using ElasticSearch, Postgresql, and Google Cloud Platform. 
- Last September, I finished working on a full-stack web and data science application with a team of fellow Lambda School students, which will enable the people served by a non-profit called SaverLife to track their spending and will help them to save their first $400.
- I have a strong understanding of many web techonologies including: JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Postgresql, and Python.
- I also excel at applying my understanding of data structures and algorithms to solve interview-style computer science problems. I particularly enjoy practicing these skills on CodeSignal https://app.codesignal.com/profile/juan_f30  

- I can best be reached via email at jmaderoflo@outlook.com, or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-gerardo-madero-flores/
